####Practice Resources

There are plenty of sites on the Internet that have a huge number of problems to work through.
Some even have contests where you can earn money!

If you're truly passionate about computer science, one of the highest honors you can achieve as a high schooler is a gold medal in the [International Olympiad of Informatics](http://www.ioinformatics.org), an international algorithmic programming competition. Every country gets to send four students, and the USA chooses who to send via the [USA Computing Olympiad](http://www.usaco.org). They have several contests during the year; they use these results, and progress in their [training program](http://www.training.usaco.org) to send 20 students to an intensive training camp where they make the final cut to send four students to the IOI.

These sites should be a fun and easy way for you hone your algorithmic skills!
